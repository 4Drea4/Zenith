# MongoDB API
## Andrea E! 
 
### Scenario/Scope:
You are a backend developer for “Zenith,” a rapidly growing e-commerce company. The company needs a robust and scalable API to manage its product inventory. This API will be the backbone of their new online store, used by internal tools for inventory management and by the public-facing website to display products to customers.

Your task is to design and build this RESTful API from the ground up using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. The API must handle all fundamental CRUD operations and include advanced features like filtering, sorting, and pagination to manage a large and complex product catalog.
